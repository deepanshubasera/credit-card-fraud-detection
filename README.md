# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project applies various machine learning algorithms to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or valid, helping in financial fraud prevention.

# Dataset
Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection

#  Key Features
1. Uses multiple machine learning models for fraud detection
2. Handles imbalanced data with techniques like oversampling and undersampling
3. Extracts key transaction features for better classification
4. Can be integrated into real-world financial systems

# How It Works
1. Preprocess the dataset (handling missing values, normalizing features).
2. Train different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
3. Evaluate model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time scenarios.
